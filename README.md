# Call-Me-When-Theres-Light
An app to call my phone number when NEPA has brought light LOL!

Its very annoying when I'm out looking for a place with electricity so I can charge my devices when there is electricity in my own house! :triumph:
How can I know when there's electricity in my house (when NEPA brings light) without someone having to tell me, or making an effort 
to find out? This was why I built this :joy:
When ever there's electricity in my house, it calls my number informing me that there's light, so I can come back home and charge
:joy: :joy: :joy:

Although it was built for my personal use, feel free to do whatever you want with it.

### Motivation
The terrible electricity supply condition where I'm at presently
